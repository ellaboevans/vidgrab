## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-08

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Intel Mac Support

- **Fixed app crash on Intel Macs** - pyffmpeg was causing hard import crashes on x86_64 architecture
  - Now skips pyffmpeg on Intel Macs and uses system FFmpeg instead
  - Graceful fallback to Homebrew ffmpeg (`/usr/local/bin/ffmpeg`)
  - Added platform/architecture detection at startup

#### Build & Distribution

- **Added Intel Mac builds to GitHub Actions** - Previously only building for Apple Silicon (arm64)
  - `macos-13` runner builds native Intel/x86_64 executable
  - `macos-latest` runner builds native Apple Silicon/arm64 executable
  - Both DMGs now included in releases: `VidGrab-intel.dmg` and `VidGrab-arm64.dmg`
  - CI/CD passes correct `--target-arch` to PyInstaller

#### Engine Improvements

- **Lazy resolution of FFmpeg/Node.js** - Moved binary detection from module import to function calls
  - Prevents hard crashes if dependency detection fails during startup
  - Better error handling and logging at each resolution step
  - Functions memoized to avoid repeated lookups

#### Build Script Enhancement

- **Architecture-aware local builds** on macOS
  - Apple Silicon: Defaults to building x86_64 for Intel users
  - Add `--universal` flag to build universal2 binary (both architectures)
  - Clear output showing detected architecture and build target

### Technical Changes

- Refactored `engine.py`:
  - `_resolve_ffmpeg()` function with lazy evaluation and architecture checks
  - `_resolve_node()` function with improved error handling
  - Platform detection using `platform.machine()` and `os.sys.platform`
  - Skip pyffmpeg on Intel macOS (x86_64, i386) to avoid crashes
- Updated `build.sh`:
  - Architecture detection and conditional builds
  - `--universal` flag support for universal2 binaries
  - Better console output with emoji indicators

- Updated `.github/workflows/build.yml`:
  - Dual macOS build matrix (arm64 + x86_64)
  - Proper artifact naming and release uploads
  - `--target-arch` passed to PyInstaller

### Tested

- ✅ Intel Mac builds in CI/CD (macos-13 runner)
- ✅ Apple Silicon builds in CI/CD (macos-latest runner)
- ✅ pyffmpeg skipped on Intel, system ffmpeg used
- ✅ Lazy binary resolution prevents import crashes
- ✅ Both DMGs uploaded to GitHub releases
- ✅ Local builds work with `./build.sh` and `./build.sh --universal`

#### Performance Metrics

- Startup: ~2-3 seconds (including splash)
- Title fetch: ~1-2 seconds per video (async)
- Single video DL: ~1.5-1.8 MiB/s
- Memory (idle): ~80-120MB
- Memory (downloading): ~150-200MB
- No memory leaks detected

---

### Fixed

- Single video progress display jumps (now smooth)
- Progress bar text visibility (cyan on cyan)
- Thread cleanup on app exit
- Metadata worker tracking
- Queue item status synchronization
- Settings not persisting (now auto-save)

### Known Limitations

1. **Sequential video+audio downloads**
   - Reason: yt-dlp limitation (no native format parallelization)
   - Workaround: Optimized individual downloads (8x fragments)
   - Impact: Minimal (still fast, transparent to user)

2. **Gatekeeper warning on macOS**
   - Reason: App not notarized (requires paid Apple Developer account)
   - Workaround: Right-click → Open or `xattr -cr` command
   - Impact: One-time user action, fully documented

3. **Large app size (~150-200MB)**
   - Reason: Includes Python, PyQt6, yt-dlp, FFmpeg
   - Benefit: No system dependencies required
   - Impact: Expected for desktop Python apps
